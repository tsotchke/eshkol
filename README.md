## üåü What is Eshkol?

Eshkol is a revolutionary programming language that combines the elegant, expressive syntax of Scheme with the raw performance of C. Designed specifically for scientific computing and artificial intelligence applications, Eshkol delivers the perfect balance between developer productivity and computational efficiency.

Unlike other languages that force you to choose between expressiveness and performance, Eshkol gives you both:

- **Write code that reads like mathematical notation** with our LISP-like syntax
- **Run at near-C speeds** thanks to our direct compilation to optimized C code
- **Manage memory deterministically** with our innovative arena-based memory system
- **Accelerate numerical computations** using built-in SIMD optimizations
- **Differentiate functions automatically** for machine learning and optimization tasks
- **Leverage existing C libraries** with zero-overhead interoperability
