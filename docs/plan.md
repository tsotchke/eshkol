## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive, phased plan to complete the Eshkol programming language, focusing on Scheme compatibility, scientific computing, AI features, ecosystem, and advanced research capabilities.

---

## Phase 1 (Q2-Q4 2025): Complete Core Language and Scheme Compatibility

### 1.1 Finalize Core Data Structures and Memory

- Arena-based memory management with deterministic, leak-free operation
- Optimized pairs, lists, vectors, strings, symbols
- Zero-copy interop with C arrays/strings
- **Success:** Passes all R5RS/R7RS list/vector/string tests; deterministic memory behavior

### 1.2 Scheme Core Language Features

- Complete P0/P1 Scheme functions:
  - Type predicates: `boolean?`, `symbol?`, `number?`, `string?`, `char?`, `procedure?`, `vector?`
  - Equality predicates: `eq?`, `eqv?`, `equal?`
  - Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
  - Extended pairs: `set-car!`, `set-cdr!`, nested `caar`, `cadr`, etc.
  - List processing: `length`, `append`, `reverse`, `list-ref`, `list-tail`, `list-set!`, `memq`, `memv`, `member`, `assq`, `assv`, `assoc`
  - Control flow: `cond`, `case`, `and`, `or`, `not`, `when`, `unless`
  - Advanced numerics: `zero?`, `positive?`, `negative?`, `odd?`, `even?`, `max`, `min`, `abs`, `quotient`, `remainder`, `modulo`, `gcd`, `lcm`
- Fix type inference issues (mutual recursion, conversions, vectors)
- Comprehensive tests and documentation
- **Success:** Passes R5RS/R7RS compliance suite for these features

## Phase 2 (2025-2026): Scientific Computing Extensions

### 2.1 Vector, Matrix, Tensor Support

- First-class types with shape/dimension metadata
- SIMD-optimized element-wise ops, dot, matmul, reductions
- BLAS/LAPACK integration with pure Eshkol fallback
- Zero-copy interop with C, NumPy
- **Success:** Outperforms Python+NumPy on benchmarks

### 2.2 Automatic Differentiation

- Forward and reverse mode (fix higher-order issues)
- Higher-order derivatives, vector/matrix autodiff
- Integration with scientific functions (ODEs, optimizers)
- **Success:** Correct gradients for complex nested functions

### 2.3 Scientific Libraries

- Statistics, signal/image processing, visualization
- GPU acceleration (CUDA/OpenCL)
- Python interoperability
- **Success:** Real-world scientific workflows fully supported

---

## Phase 3 (2026-2027): AI-Specific Features

### 3.1 Neural Network DSL

- Layer abstractions, model composition
- Automatic batching, parallelism, GPU acceleration
- Integration with autodiff
- **Success:** Efficient training/testing of standard models

### 3.2 Neuro-Symbolic Integration

- Symbolic reasoning primitives, hybrid models
- Explainability tools
- **Success:** Neuro-symbolic theorem proving, program synthesis

### 3.3 Reinforcement Learning

- Environment abstractions, policy/value APIs
- Distributed training support
- **Success:** RL agents trained on standard benchmarks

---

## Phase 4 (2027-2028): Ecosystem and Tooling

- Package manager, central repo
- IDE integration, advanced debugging/profiling
- Community infrastructure, tutorials, docs
- **Success:** Productive developer experience, active community

---

## Phase 5 (2028+): Advanced Features and Research

- Effect system, dependent/linear/refinement types
- LLVM backend, JIT compilation
- Quantum computing, probabilistic programming
- Formal verification, program synthesis
- **Success:** Cutting-edge research features integrated

---

## Next Steps

This plan will be executed via **granular developer tasks** saved under `docs/tasks/`, each with:

- Description and scope
- Dependencies
- Resources (docs, diagrams, articles)
- Detailed instructions, pseudocode, or library references
- Success criteria

---

_This plan is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves._
