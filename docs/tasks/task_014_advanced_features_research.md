# Task 014: Implement Advanced Language Features and Research Directions

---

## Description

Develop advanced language features and research-driven capabilities in Eshkol, including:

- Effect system for tracking and controlling side effects
- Dependent types for expressive type-level programming
- Linear types for resource management
- Refinement types for stronger correctness guarantees
- LLVM backend and JIT compilation
- Quantum computing support
- Probabilistic programming features
- Program synthesis and formal verification tools

These features push the boundaries of language design and enable new domains.

---

## Dependencies

- Core language features must be stable.
- Type system infrastructure must be extensible.
- Compiler architecture must support new backends and analyses.

---

## Resources

- Eshkol docs: `docs/vision/FUTURE_ROADMAP.md`, technical white paper
- Research papers on effect systems, dependent/linear/refinement types
- LLVM documentation
- Quantum computing frameworks (Qiskit, Cirq)
- Probabilistic programming languages (Stan, Pyro)
- Formal verification tools (Coq, Lean, Dafny)
