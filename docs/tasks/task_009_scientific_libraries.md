# Task 009: Implement Scientific Computing Libraries

---

## Description

Develop core scientific computing libraries in Eshkol, including:

- **Statistics**: mean, variance, t-tests, regressions
- **Signal and image processing**: FFT, filters, transforms
- **Numerical methods**: integration, differentiation, optimization, ODE solvers
- **Visualization**: plotting APIs, export formats
- **GPU acceleration**: CUDA/OpenCL kernels, fallback CPU
- **Python interoperability**: zero-copy data sharing, function calls

These libraries enable real-world scientific workflows.

---

## Dependencies

- **Task 007: Vector, matrix, tensor support**
- **Task 008: Automatic differentiation**
- Advanced numerics and basic math functions
- C FFI and Python interop must be functional
- Basic plotting/image libraries or bindings

---

## Resources

- Eshkol docs: `docs/vision/SCIENTIFIC_COMPUTING.md`
- BLAS/LAPACK, FFTW documentation
- CUDA/OpenCL documentation
- Python C API and NumPy array interface
- Popular scientific libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib) for reference

## Detailed Instructions

1. **Design**

   - Define APIs for each library area.
   - Plan integration with vectors/matrices and autodiff.
   - Design zero-copy interop with Python/NumPy.
   - Plan GPU acceleration with graceful fallback.
   - Define visualization API and supported formats.

2. **Implementation**

   - Implement statistics functions with autodiff support.
   - Implement FFT, filters, transforms with SIMD/GPU acceleration.
   - Implement numerical methods (integration, optimization, ODEs).
   - Implement plotting APIs, export to images/files.
   - Integrate with CUDA/OpenCL for acceleration.
   - Implement Python interop (data sharing, function calls).
   - Handle edge cases and errors.

3. **Testing**

   - Unit tests for all functions:
     - Correctness
     - Edge cases
     - Performance
   - Compare with NumPy/SciPy results.
   - Integration tests with scientific workflows.
   - Performance benchmarks (CPU, GPU).

4. **Documentation**

   - For all APIs, document:
     - Signatures
     - Examples
     - Edge cases
     - Performance notes
