# Task 008: Implement Automatic Differentiation (Autodiff)

---

## Description

Implement built-in automatic differentiation in Eshkol, including:

- Forward mode autodiff
- Reverse mode autodiff (backpropagation)
- Higher-order derivatives
- Vector and matrix autodiff
- Integration with scientific and AI functions
- Support for user-defined functions
- Efficient memory and tape management

This enables differentiable programming, essential for scientific computing and AI.
