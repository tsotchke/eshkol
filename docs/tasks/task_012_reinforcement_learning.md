# Task 012: Implement Reinforcement Learning (RL) Framework

---

## Description

Develop a reinforcement learning framework in Eshkol, including:

- Environment abstractions (OpenAI Gym compatible)
- Policy and value function APIs
- Common RL algorithms (Q-learning, policy gradients, actor-critic)
- Support for distributed training
- Integration with neural network DSL and neuro-symbolic components
- Tools for experiment tracking and visualization

This enables development of RL agents for various domains.
