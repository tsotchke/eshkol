# Sub-Task 002-09: Handle Cyclic Structures in `equal?`

---

## Description

Implement detection and safe handling of cyclic data structures in the `equal?` predicate to avoid infinite recursion.

---

## Dependencies

- Basic `equal?` implementation for pairs, vectors, strings.
- Knowledge of data structure traversal.

---

## Instructions

- Use cycle detection algorithms (e.g., tortoise and hare, visited set).
- Track visited pairs/vectors during recursion.
- Return `#t` if cycles are equivalent, else `#f`.
- Avoid infinite loops on self-referential structures.
- Add tests for cyclic and acyclic cases.

---

## Success Criteria

- Correctly handles cyclic structures without infinite recursion.
- Passes unit tests for cyclic and nested data.
- Well-documented with examples.

---

## Status

_Not started_

---

## Notes

- Optimize for acyclic common case.
- Plan for future improvements (hash-consing, memoization).
- Ensure compatibility with gradual typing.
