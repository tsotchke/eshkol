# Sub-Task 002-06: Implement Pair/List Equality in `equal?`

---

## Description

Implement recursive equality checking for pairs and lists in the `equal?` predicate.

---

## Dependencies

- Pair/list data structures and accessors (`car`, `cdr`).
- Basic `equal?` implementation.

---

## Instructions

- Recursively compare `car` and `cdr` of both pairs.
- Return `#t` if all corresponding elements are `equal?`.
- Return `#f` if lengths differ or any element differs.
- Handle empty lists (`null`) correctly.
- Avoid infinite loops on cyclic lists (optional for initial version).
- Add tests for nested and empty lists.

---

## Success Criteria

- Correctly identifies deep equality of lists.
- Passes unit tests for nested, empty, and improper lists.
- Well-documented with examples.

---

## Status

_Not started_

---

## Notes

- Consider cycle detection for robustness.
- Optimize common cases (identical references).
- Ensure compatibility with gradual typing.
