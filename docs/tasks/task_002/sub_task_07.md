# Sub-Task 002-07: Implement Vector Equality in `equal?`

---

## Description

Implement recursive equality checking for vectors in the `equal?` predicate.

---

## Dependencies

- Vector data structures and accessors.
- Basic `equal?` implementation.

---

## Instructions

- Compare vector lengths first.
- Recursively compare each element using `equal?`.
- Return `#t` if all elements match, else `#f`.
- Handle empty vectors correctly.
- Add tests for nested vectors, empty vectors, and mismatched lengths.

---

## Success Criteria

- Correctly identifies deep equality of vectors.
- Passes unit tests for nested, empty, and mismatched vectors.
- Well-documented with examples.

---

## Status

_Not started_

---

## Notes

- Optimize common cases (identical references).
- Plan for future support of sparse vectors.
- Ensure compatibility with gradual typing.
