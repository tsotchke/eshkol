# Sub-Task 002-10: Create Unit Tests and Documentation for Equality Predicates

---

## Description

Develop comprehensive unit tests and documentation for the Scheme equality predicates:

- `eq?`
- `eqv?`
- `equal?`

---

## Dependencies

- Predicate implementations should be available or stubbed.
- Test framework or harness must be functional.
- Documentation framework or format should be defined.

---

## Instructions

- Write positive tests (correctly identify equal/equivalent objects).
- Write negative tests (correctly reject unequal objects).
- Cover edge cases (NaN, infinities, cyclic structures).
- Automate tests with pass/fail output.
- For each predicate, document:
  - Signature
  - Description
  - Expected behavior
  - Examples (positive and negative cases)
  - Edge cases
  - Known limitations
- Organize docs clearly and consistently.
- Link to relevant Scheme standards (R5RS, R7RS).

---

## Success Criteria

- Tests cover all predicates and edge cases.
- Tests pass when predicates are correct.
- Failures clearly indicate issues.
- Documentation is clear, accurate, and example-rich.
- Integrated into overall Eshkol documentation.

---

## Status

_Not started_

---

## Notes

- Coordinate with unit tests for type predicates.
- Plan for integration into CI pipeline.
- Consider property-based tests for robustness.
