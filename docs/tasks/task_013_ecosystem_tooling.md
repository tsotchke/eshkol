# Task 013: Develop Ecosystem and Tooling

---

## Description

Develop the Eshkol ecosystem and tooling, including:

- Package manager with central repository
- Dependency management, versioning, compatibility checking
- IDE integration (VSCode, JetBrains, etc.)
- Advanced debugging, profiling, and refactoring tools
- Community infrastructure (forums, tutorials, docs, governance)
- Learning resources (interactive tutorials, examples, course materials)
- Integration with other ecosystems (web, mobile, cloud, IoT)

This enables productive development and community growth.

---

## Dependencies

- Core language features must be stable.
- Build system and compiler must be functional.
- Basic documentation must be available.

---

## Resources

- Eshkol docs: `docs/vision/FUTURE_ROADMAP.md`
- Package managers (npm, pip, cargo) for reference
- IDE extension APIs (VSCode, JetBrains)
- Debugging/profiling tool documentation
- Community platform best practices

---

## Detailed Instructions

1. **Design**

   - Define package manager features and CLI.
   - Plan central repository infrastructure.
   - Design IDE extensions (syntax, linting, debugging).
   - Plan advanced tooling (profiling, refactoring).
   - Develop community platform and governance model.
   - Create learning resources and tutorials.

2. **Implementation**

   - Implement package manager CLI and backend.
   - Develop central package repository.
   - Build IDE extensions for major editors.
   - Develop debugging, profiling, refactoring tools.
   - Launch community platform (forums, docs).
   - Develop interactive tutorials and examples.
   - Integrate with other ecosystems (web, mobile, cloud).

3. **Testing**

   - Unit and integration tests for package manager.
   - User testing of IDE extensions and tools.
   - Community feedback on platform and resources.
   - Performance benchmarks for tooling.

4. **Documentation**

   - For all tools and resources, document:
     - Usage
     - Examples
     - Edge cases
     - Contribution guidelines
