# Sub-Task 001-10: Write Documentation and Examples for Type Predicates

---

## Description

Write comprehensive documentation and usage examples for all Scheme type predicates in Eshkol:

- `boolean?`
- `symbol?`
- `number?`
- `string?`
- `char?`
- `procedure?`
- `vector?`

---

## Dependencies

- Predicate implementations should be available or stubbed.
- Basic documentation framework or format should be defined.

---

## Instructions

- For each predicate, document:
  - Signature
  - Description
  - Expected behavior
  - Examples (positive and negative cases)
  - Edge cases
  - Known limitations
- Organize docs clearly and consistently.
- Link to relevant Scheme standards (R5RS, R7RS).
- Include in user/developer documentation set.

---

## Success Criteria

- Clear, accurate documentation for all predicates.
- Includes examples covering typical and edge cases.
- Easy to understand and maintain.
- Integrated into overall Eshkol documentation.

---

## Status

_Not started_

---

## Notes

- Coordinate with unit tests for examples.
- Plan for future auto-generation or extraction.
- Ensure compatibility with gradual typing explanations.
