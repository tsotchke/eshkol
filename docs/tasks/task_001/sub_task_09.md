# Sub-Task 001-09: Create Unit Tests for Type Predicates

---

## Description

Develop comprehensive unit tests for all Scheme type predicates in Eshkol:

- `boolean?`
- `symbol?`
- `number?`
- `string?`
- `char?`
- `procedure?`
- `vector?`

---

## Dependencies

- Predicate implementations should be available or stubbed.
- Test framework or harness must be functional.

---

## Instructions

- Write positive tests (correctly identify type).
- Write negative tests (correctly reject other types).
- Cover edge cases (null, nested structures, uninitialized values).
- Automate tests with pass/fail output.
- Organize tests clearly by predicate.

---

## Success Criteria

- Tests cover all predicates and edge cases.
- Tests pass when predicates are correct.
- Failures clearly indicate issues.
- Tests are maintainable and well-documented.

---

## Status

_Not started_

---

## Notes

- Plan for integration into CI pipeline.
- Consider property-based tests for robustness.
- Coordinate with documentation examples.
