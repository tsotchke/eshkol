# Task 011: Implement Neuro-Symbolic Integration

---

## Description

Develop features in Eshkol to enable seamless integration of neural networks with symbolic reasoning, including:

- Symbolic reasoning primitives (logic, rules, knowledge graphs)
- Hybrid model composition (neural + symbolic components)
- Differentiable reasoning components
- Explainability tools (trace reasoning paths, visualize activations)
- Support for program synthesis and meta-learning
- Case studies: neuro-symbolic theorem proving, self-improving code

This enables next-generation AI systems combining learning and reasoning.
