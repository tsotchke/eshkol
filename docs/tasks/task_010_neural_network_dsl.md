# Task 010: Implement Neural Network DSL and Primitives

---

## Description

Develop a domain-specific language (DSL) and core primitives in Eshkol for defining, training, and deploying neural networks, including:

- Layer abstractions: dense, convolutional, pooling, dropout, activation
- Model composition: sequential, functional, graph-based
- Automatic batching and parallelism
- GPU acceleration
- Integration with autodiff for training
- Export/import of models
- Support for custom layers and loss functions

This enables efficient, expressive AI development.
