# Sub-Task 003-01: Implement `length` Function

---

## Description

Implement the Scheme function `(length list)` in Eshkol, which returns the number of elements in a proper list.

---

## Dependencies

- Pair/list data structures and accessors (`car`, `cdr`).
- Basic function definition support.

---

## Instructions

- Traverse the list, counting elements until `null`.
- Return the count as an integer.
- Error or handle improper lists (optional).
- Add tests for empty, nested, and long lists.

---

## Success Criteria

- Correctly returns length of proper lists.
- Passes unit tests for various list cases.
- Well-documented with examples.

---

## Status

_Not started_

---

## Notes

- Optimize for tail recursion or iteration.
- Plan for future support of improper lists.
- Ensure compatibility with gradual typing.
