# Sub-Task 003-03: Implement `reverse` Function

---

## Description

Implement the Scheme function `(reverse list)` in Eshkol, which returns a new list with the elements of `list` in reverse order.

---

## Dependencies

- Pair/list data structures and accessors.
- Basic function definition support.

---

## Instructions

- Traverse the list, prepending elements to a new list.
- Return the new reversed list.
- Handle empty lists correctly.
- Add tests for empty, nested, and long lists.

---

## Success Criteria

- Correctly reverses lists per Scheme semantics.
- Passes unit tests for various list cases.
- Well-documented with examples.

---

## Status

_Not started_

---

## Notes

- Optimize for tail recursion or iteration.
- Plan for future support of improper lists.
- Ensure compatibility with gradual typing.
