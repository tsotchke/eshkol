# Task 007: Implement Vector, Matrix, and Tensor Support

---

## Description

Implement first-class support for vectors, matrices, and tensors in Eshkol, including:

- Type definitions with shape/dimension metadata
- Creation, indexing, slicing
- Element-wise operations
- Dot products, matrix multiplication
- Reductions (sum, mean, etc.)
- Integration with BLAS/LAPACK
- SIMD optimization
- Zero-copy interop with C and NumPy

This is foundational for scientific computing and AI workloads.

---

## Dependencies

- **Task 006: Advanced numerics**
- Core memory management and type system must support these types.
- Basic arithmetic operations must be implemented.
- C FFI must be functional for BLAS/LAPACK integration.

## Detailed Instructions

1. **Design**

   - Define internal representations for fixed-size and dynamic vectors/matrices/tensors.
   - Include shape/dimension metadata in type system.
   - Plan API for creation, indexing, slicing, and operations.
   - Design zero-copy interop with C arrays and NumPy.

2. **Implementation**

   - Implement constructors and accessors.
   - Implement element-wise operations with SIMD optimization.
   - Implement dot product, matrix multiplication, reductions.
   - Integrate with BLAS/LAPACK for optimized operations.
   - Support slicing and broadcasting semantics.
   - Handle edge cases (empty, mismatched shapes).

3. **Testing**

   - Unit tests for all operations:
     - Creation, indexing, slicing
     - Element-wise ops
     - Dot/matrix multiplication
     - Reductions
     - Interop with C/NumPy
   - Performance benchmarks (SIMD, BLAS/LAPACK).
   - Integration tests with scientific and AI code.

4. **Documentation**

   - For all APIs, document:
     - Signatures
     - Examples
     - Edge cases
     - Performance notes
