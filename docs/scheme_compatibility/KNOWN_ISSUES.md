## Function Composition Status

The function composition system has been significantly improved with the implementation of a JIT compilation approach. This enables efficient function composition with proper handling of calling conventions. However, there are still some limitations:

1. **Current Status**: The basic function composition mechanism works, but there are edge cases and advanced patterns that may not work correctly.

2. **Recent Improvements**:
   - JIT compilation for efficient machine code generation
   - Support for both x86-64 and ARM64 architectures
   - Fallback mechanism for environments where JIT isn't possible
   - Proper handling of closure calling conventions

3. **Known Limitations**:
   - Complex composition chains may not work correctly in all cases
   - Type inference for composed functions is incomplete
   - Performance optimizations are still in progress

4. **Workarounds**:
   - Use simple binary function composition where possible
   - Break complex compositions into simpler steps
   - Use explicit type annotations for composed functions
   - Test composed functions thoroughly before using in production code
   - Use the MCP tools to analyze function composition patterns:
     ```bash
     use_mcp_tool eshkol-tools analyze-composition-chains '{"filePath": "examples/function_composition_test.esk", "detail": "detailed"}'
     ```

For more details on the function composition implementation, see [function_composition_solution_summary.md](../../function_composition_solution_summary.md).

## Closure System and Global Variable Status

The closure and global variable handling system has been improved with the implementation of a two-phase initialization approach and better validation. This enables safer usage of closures stored in global variables. However, there are still some limitations:

1. **Current Status**: Basic closures work correctly, but global variables containing closures require special handling.

2. **Recent Improvements**:
   - Two-phase initialization for global variables (declare with NULL, initialize in main)
   - Added `eshkol_is_closure` function for validating closures
   - Created `call_closure` helper function for safe closure calls
   - Improved context-based code generation for global vs. function contexts
   - Enhanced validation before closure operations

3. **Known Limitations**:
   - Closures in global variables may not be correctly initialized in some cases
   - Generated C code does not fully support function calls in global initializers
   - Validation of closure objects is not comprehensive
   - Memory management for shared environments needs improvement

4. **Workarounds**:
   - Always validate closures before using them, especially from global variables
   - Use the `call_closure` helper function instead of direct calls
   - Initialize global variables in the main function, not at global scope
   - Use MCP tools to analyze closure usage and potential issues:
     ```bash
     use_mcp_tool eshkol-tools analyze-lambda-captures '{"filePath": "examples/minimal_lambda.esk", "detail": "detailed"}'
     ```
   - Break complex lambdas into simpler functions when used in global context

## Compatibility Notes

### R5RS vs. R7RS Differences

Eshkol aims to be compatible with both R5RS and R7RS-small, but there are some differences in how these standards are implemented:

1. **Character and String Encoding**: Eshkol uses Unicode (as specified in R7RS) rather than the unspecified encoding in R5RS.
2. **Exact/Inexact Numbers**: Eshkol follows the R7RS approach to exact and inexact numbers.
3. **Additional Procedures**: Eshkol implements the additional procedures specified in R7RS.
4. **Exception Handling**: Eshkol uses the R7RS exception system.

### Implementation-Specific Behavior

Eshkol has some implementation-specific behavior that may differ from other Scheme implementations:

1. **Memory Management**: Eshkol uses a hybrid memory management approach rather than traditional garbage collection.
2. **Compilation Model**: Eshkol compiles to C rather than interpreting or compiling directly to machine code.
3. **Type Annotations**: Eshkol supports optional static type annotations, which are not part of standard Scheme.
4. **Scientific Computing Extensions**: Eshkol includes additional vector and matrix operations for scientific computing.
5. **Automatic Differentiation**: Eshkol includes support for automatic differentiation, which is not part of standard Scheme.
6. **MCP Tools Integration**: Eshkol provides MCP tools for analyzing Scheme code, which are not part of standard Scheme.

### Standard Library Limitations

The following standard library features are not yet fully implemented:

1. **List Operations**: 
   - Core list operations (cons, car, cdr) have been implemented.
   - Additional list processing functions (length, append, reverse, etc.) are planned for Q2 2025.
   - See [list_processing_roadmap.md](./roadmaps/list_processing_roadmap.md) for details.

2. **Type Predicates**: 
   - Basic type predicates (pair?, null?, list?) are in the planning stage.
   - Implementation roadmap has been created.
   - See [type_predicates_roadmap.md](./roadmaps/type_predicates_roadmap.md) for details.

3. **Equality Predicates**:
   - Equality predicates (eq?, eqv?, equal?) are in the planning stage.
   - Implementation roadmap has been created.
   - See [equality_predicates_roadmap.md](./roadmaps/equality_predicates_roadmap.md) for details.

4. **Higher-Order Functions**:
   - Higher-order functions (map, for-each, filter, etc.) are in the planning stage.
   - Implementation roadmap has been created.
   - See [higher_order_functions_roadmap.md](./roadmaps/higher_order_functions_roadmap.md) for details.

5. **Complex Numbers**: Complex number support is planned for Phase 7.

6. **Rational Numbers**: Rational number support is planned for Phase 7.

7. **Library System**: The R7RS library system is not yet fully implemented.

8. **Dynamic FFI**: Dynamic foreign function interface is not yet implemented.

## Deferred Features

The following features are intentionally deferred to later phases:

1. **Full Continuations**: Full continuations support is deferred to Phase 5.
2. **Hygienic Macros**: Hygienic macro system is deferred to Phase 7.
3. **Full Numeric Tower**: Complete numeric tower is deferred to Phase 7.
4. **Advanced I/O**: Advanced I/O features are deferred to Phase 5.
5. **Module System**: Enhanced module system is deferred to Phase 7.

## MCP Tools Issues

The following issues affect the MCP tools used for Scheme compatibility analysis:

1. **Type Analysis Simplification**: The analyze-types tool uses a simplified implementation that doesn't fully parse the code.
2. **Binding Analysis Limitations**: The analyze-bindings and analyze-lambda-captures tools may not correctly handle complex binding patterns.
3. **Recursion Analysis Limitations**: The analyze-scheme-recursion and analyze-tscheme-recursion tools may not correctly handle all forms of mutual recursion.
4. **Integration Issues**: The MCP tools are not fully integrated with the compiler pipeline.

## Workarounds

### Tail Call Optimization

Until proper tail call optimization is implemented, you can work around stack overflow issues by:

1. Using iterative algorithms instead of recursive ones
2. Manually implementing trampolines for deeply recursive functions
3. Using loop constructs like `do` instead of recursion

### Type System Integration

Until the type system is fully integrated with Scheme, you can:

1. Use untyped Scheme code for most functionality
2. Use type annotations only for performance-critical code
3. Be aware that type errors may not be caught until runtime

### Autodiff and Vector Type Issues

To work around the current issues with automatic differentiation and vector types:

1. Use explicit type annotations for functions that return vectors
   ```scheme
   (: sum-of-squares-gradient-forward (-> float float (Vector float)))
   (define (sum-of-squares-gradient-forward x y)
     (autodiff-forward-gradient sum-of-squares (vector x y)))
   ```

2. Avoid mixing scalar and vector operations in complex expressions
   ```scheme
   ;; Instead of this:
   (define result (+ (vector-ref gradient 0) (* 2 (vector-ref gradient 1))))
   
   ;; Do this:
   (define g0 (vector-ref gradient 0))
   (define g1 (vector-ref gradient 1))
   (define result (+ g0 (* 2 g1)))
   ```

3. Use intermediate variables with explicit types for autodiff results
   ```scheme
   (define gradient (autodiff-forward-gradient f input-vec))
   (: dx float)
   (define dx (vector-ref gradient 0))
   (: dy float)
   (define dy (vector-ref gradient 1))
   ```

4. For complex autodiff operations, consider breaking them down into simpler steps with explicit types

5. Use the MCP tools to analyze your code for potential issues:
   ```bash
   # Analyze type inference for an Eshkol file
   use_mcp_tool eshkol-tools analyze-types '{"filePath": "examples/autodiff_example.esk", "detail": "detailed"}'
   
   # Analyze lambda captures for an Eshkol file
   use_mcp_tool eshkol-tools analyze-lambda-captures '{"filePath": "examples/autodiff_example.esk", "detail": "detailed"}'
   ```

### Lambda Capture Issues

To work around issues with lambda captures in autodiff functions:

1. Avoid capturing mutable variables in lambdas passed to autodiff functions
2. Use explicit parameter passing instead of capturing variables
3. Break complex higher-order functions into simpler functions
4. Use the analyze-lambda-captures MCP tool to identify potential issues

### Numeric Tower Limitations

Until the full numeric tower is implemented, you can:

1. Use floating-point numbers for most calculations
2. Be aware of precision limitations
3. Implement your own rational or complex number types if needed

### MCP Tools Limitations

To work around limitations in the MCP tools:

1. Use the tools as guidance rather than relying on them for complete analysis
2. Verify tool results manually, especially for complex code
3. Use multiple tools to get a more complete picture
4. Report issues with the tools to help improve them
