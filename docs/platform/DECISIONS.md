# Platform Program Decisions

This file is an append-only log of architecture and governance decisions for the freestanding / platform program.

## Status Values

- `Accepted`
- `Provisional`
- `Superseded`
- `Deferred`

## D-0001

- Date: 2026-04-15
- Status: Accepted
- Title: Start the platform program during `v1.2-scale`

### Context

The public roadmap places embedded cross-compilation in `v1.8-platform`, but the compiler, runtime, and language work needed for that milestone is too large to begin only at `v1.8`.

### Decision

Start the platform program during `v1.2-scale` as a parallel infrastructure effort that converges into the public roadmap by `v1.8-platform`.

### Consequences

- platform work can proceed now
- public roadmap wording does not need to change drastically
- only merge-safe infrastructure lands early

---

## D-0002

- Date: 2026-04-15
- Status: Accepted
- Title: Use a long-lived platform branch

### Context

The current active branch is `feature/v1.2-scale`, and there is already active work in central compiler/runtime files.

### Decision

Use:

- `feature/v1.2-scale` as the current release integration branch
- `feature/platform-freestanding` as the long-lived platform branch

### Consequences

- platform work can advance without destabilizing the release stream
- regular merge discipline is required

---

## D-0003

- Date: 2026-04-15
- Status: Accepted
- Title: The first deliverable is a freestanding toolchain, not a kernel

### Context

The temptation is to start immediately with a bootloader or kernel implementation.

### Decision

The first success metric is a stable freestanding Eshkol platform:

- profiles
- runtime split
- low-level language surface
- freestanding LLVM path
- BSP contract

Kernel work begins downstream only after that foundation exists.

### Consequences

- effort stays focused on reusable infrastructure
- `eshkol-kernel` remains downstream

---

## D-0004

- Date: 2026-04-15
- Status: Accepted
- Title: The VM is a first-class part of the platform strategy

### Context

Eshkol already has a production VM and ESKB format. It is useful beyond browser deployment.

### Decision

The platform program explicitly includes a `freestanding-vm` profile and a VM host-hook architecture.

### Consequences

- platform portability is not limited to LLVM-native targets
- the VM becomes a candidate runtime for monitors, recovery, and constrained systems

---

## D-0005

- Date: 2026-04-15
- Status: Accepted
- Title: First reference targets are QEMU-friendly general-purpose ISAs

### Context

The initial goal is to validate the platform architecture quickly and repeatably.

### Decision

Use these reference targets in order:

1. x86_64 QEMU PC
2. AArch64 QEMU virt
3. RISC-V QEMU virt

Real MCU support comes later once the freestanding contract is stable.

### Consequences

- first bring-up stays debuggable and automatable
- MCU-specific work does not block the core platform architecture

---

## D-0006

- Date: 2026-04-15
- Status: Accepted
- Title: Governance is founder-led with bounded delegation

### Context

The founder/maintainer is doing most of the work, but some bounded tasks may be delegated.

### Decision

Core architecture, syntax, runtime boundary, and repo-boundary decisions remain centralized. Delegation is implementation-focused and topic-branch bounded.

### Consequences

- design coherence is preserved
- helpers can still contribute effectively on decision-complete tasks
