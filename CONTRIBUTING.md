## Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to adhere to our Code of Conduct. Please be respectful and considerate of others when participating in our community.

## Getting Started

### Development Environment Setup

To set up your development environment for Eshkol, you'll need:

1. **C/C++ Compiler**
   - GCC 9.0+ or Clang 10.0+
   - On macOS: `brew install gcc` or use the default Clang
   - On Linux: `sudo apt install build-essential`
   - On Windows: Install MinGW or use WSL

2. **CMake**
   - Version 3.12 or higher
   - On macOS: `brew install cmake`
   - On Linux: `sudo apt install cmake`
   - On Windows: Download from [cmake.org](https://cmake.org/download/)

3. **Node.js** (for MCP tools)
   - Version 14.0+ recommended
   - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

4. **Git**
   - On macOS: `brew install git`
   - On Linux: `sudo apt install git`
   - On Windows: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tsotchke/eshkol.git
   cd eshkol
   ```

2. Create a build directory and build the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

3. Clean generated files from examples directory (before committing):
   ```bash
   # Run the clean_examples.sh script to remove generated files from Git tracking
   ./clean_examples.sh
   ```

3. Install the MCP tools (optional, for development tools):
   ```bash
   cd ../eshkol-tools
   npm install
   ```

### Running Tests

Run the test suite to ensure everything is working correctly:

```bash
cd build
ctest
```

Or run specific test categories:

```bash
# Run unit tests only
ctest -R unit

# Run integration tests only
ctest -R integration
```

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improvement:

1. Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tsotchke/eshkol/issues) to see if the issue has already been reported.
2. If not, create a new issue with a clear title and description.
3. Include steps to reproduce the issue, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
4. If possible, include code examples, logs, or screenshots.

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for new features or improvements:

1. Check the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) to see if your suggestion is already planned.
2. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates.
3. Create a new issue with the label "enhancement".
4. Clearly describe the feature and its benefits.
5. If possible, outline how the feature might be implemented.

### Pull Requests

We follow a standard GitHub flow for contributions:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `git checkout -b fix/issue-description`.
3. Make your changes, following our [coding standards](#coding-standards).
4. Add or update tests as necessary.
5. Update documentation to reflect your changes.
6. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages.
7. Push your branch to your fork: `git push origin your-branch-name`.
8. Submit a pull request to the `main` branch of the Eshkol repository.
9. Respond to any feedback or questions during the review process.

## Development Guidelines

### Coding Standards

We follow these coding standards for consistency:

#### C Code

- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs).
- Follow the [Linux kernel coding style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html) with some modifications:
  - Use camelCase for function names and variables.
  - Use PascalCase for struct and enum names.
  - Use ALL_CAPS for macros and constants.
- Prefix all public functions with `eshkol_`.
- Keep lines under 100 characters when possible.
- Add comments for complex logic or non-obvious behavior.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.

#### TypeScript Code (MCP Tools)

- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Follow the [TypeScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html).
- Use camelCase for variables and functions.
- Use PascalCase for classes, interfaces, and type aliases.
- Use descriptive names and add JSDoc comments.

### Documentation

Good documentation is crucial for the project:

- Update relevant documentation when making changes.
- Document all public APIs with clear descriptions, parameters, and return values.
- Add examples for complex features.
- Keep the README and other high-level documentation up to date.
- Use Markdown for all documentation files.

### Testing

We strive for good test coverage:

- Add tests for new features.
- Update tests when modifying existing features.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
- Follow the existing test patterns in the codebase.
