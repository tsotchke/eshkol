=== PHASE 2A GROUP A TEST ===
1. Testing length:
   length of (1 2.5 3 4.75 5): 5 (expect: 5)
2. Testing list-ref:
   (list-ref mixed-list 0): 1 (expect: 1)
   (list-ref mixed-list 1): 2.500000 (expect: 2.5)
   (list-ref mixed-list 2): 3 (expect: 3)
   (list-ref mixed-list 3): 4.750000 (expect: 4.75)
   (list-ref mixed-list 4): 5 (expect: 5)
3. Testing list-tail:
   (list-tail mixed-list 2) first element: 3 (expect: 3)
   (list-tail mixed-list 3) first element: 4.750000 (expect: 4.75)
4. Testing drop:
   (drop mixed-list 2) first element: 3 (expect: 3)
   length of (drop mixed-list 3): 2 (expect: 2)
5. Testing last:
   (last mixed-list): 5 (expect: 5)
   (last (list 1 2.5 3)): 3 (expect: 3)
6. Testing last-pair:
   (car (last-pair mixed-list)): 5 (expect: 5)
7. Testing combined operations:
   length of (list-tail mixed-list 2): 3 (expect: 3)
